<h1>Silas' 2019 Retrospective</h1>
<h2>Old Unity Experiments</h2>
<p>Around this time I made a lot of short little goofs in Unity, I didn't really make much cuz at the time I litterally could not code at all cuz I didn't take the time to learn how so most of my stuff is just script-kittied. I unfortunately deleted all of them for space so nothing was archived. However, I still have my old Itch account and was able to find a game on there, that being Space Killer, it's unfinished and sucks, probably because i was a young, impressonate child back when I made it.</p>
